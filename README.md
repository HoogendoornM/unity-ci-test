Testing continuous integration for Unity projects

This project uses the [excellent tutorial by Jonathan Porta](https://jonathan.porta.codes/2015/04/17/automatically-build-your-unity3d-project-in-the-cloud-using-travisci-for-free/) as well as the [Unity manual on the test runner](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/testing-editortestsrunner.html) to run unit tests on TravisCI and proceed to build the project.
